#express practice application

###This is a practice express.js app that I'll be making along with a tutorial by Travesty media. Any notes I need will be taken here. 

You need Node.js installed. 

you need two bash commands at the very least. 
`$npm init` : creates a package.json file
`$npm install express` ...duh. 

You can press enter for each thing, except:
description
you can change the entry point name if you want
initialize a git in the folder where your app will be, the json fo;e will read it. 

You can add your dependancies like express to the json file as "dependancies":

`"dependancies":{
    "express":"*",
    //etc
},`

Please note! The comma is very important in a JSON file!
Also note! `"*"` will mean the latest version.  

After that, run `npm install`
